# What is Glacier Tracker?
Glacier Tracker is a Google Earth Engine (GEE) Web App for tracking glacial retreat over time. Glacier Tracker provides the user with side-by-side visualizations of Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 imagery. The user can dynamically change the Landsat filtering so that you can fully customize what images are provided. The user is also able to click anywhere on the map to generate a GIF using Sentinel-2 imagery. The goal of Glacier Tracker is to emphasize the dire state of our plant. I hope it can be used to raise concern for climate change and the negative effects associated with it.
