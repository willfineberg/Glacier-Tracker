# What is Glacier Tracker?
Glacier Tracker is a Google Earth Engine (GEE) Web App for tracking glacial retreat over time. Glacier Tracker provides the user with side-by-side visualizations of Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 imagery. The user can dynamically change the Landsat filtering so that you can fully customize what images are provided. The user is also able to click anywhere on the map to generate a GIF using Sentinel-2 imagery. The goal of Glacier Tracker is to emphasize the dire state of our plant. I hope it can be used to raise concern for climate change and the negative effects associated with it.

# Written Report
This GEE Web App was produced as a Final Project for Earth Observation II at DePaul University. The written report for this project is provided in `GlacierTrackerReport_Fineberg.pdf`.

# GEE JS Source Code
The source code can be found in `GlacierTracker.js`. This code was implemented inside the GEE editor. As a result, it may require some modification to be implemented externally using the GEE API.
